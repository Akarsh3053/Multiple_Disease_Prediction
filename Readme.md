# Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This is a machine learning app that can predict multiple diseases using machine learning. All these models can be accessed through a single web app built using Streamlit. All the prediction models are pre-trained on a large data set and can generate accurate results with input parameters for that particular disease.

## Features 
- Interactive web dashboard
- Mobile friendly interface
- Can be easily extended and customized
